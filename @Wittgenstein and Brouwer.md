- [[Abstract]]
	- In this paper, I present a summary of the philosophical relationship between Wittgenstein and Brouwer, taking as my point of departure Brouwer's lecture on March 10, 1928 in Vienna. I argue that Wittgenstein having at that stage not done serious philosoph ical work for years, if one is to understand the impact of that lecture on him, it is better to compare its content with the remarks on logics and mathematics in the Tractactus. I thus show that Wittgenstein's position, in the Tractactus, was already quite close to Brouwer's and that the points of divergence are the basis to Wittgenstein's later criticisms of intu itionism. Among the topics of comparison are the role of intuition in mathematics, rule following, choice sequences, the Law of Excluded Middle, and the primacy of arithmetic over logic.
